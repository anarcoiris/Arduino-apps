Time Plotter is a code that takes 10 measurements of the requested vs real elapsed time for the microsecondDelay function in 500us increments up to 50000us.
I have found this to be helpful to test device capabilities. I guess this depends on the MCU clock frequency, but I still don't have answers to all the questions 
that arise from running this code. It has been a bit painful to achieve requested delays for precision requiring apps, so maybe it can save others some time.
Noticed the time was somehow 2.58 shorter (10250 us instead of 26500us requested). Going linearly for 68500 wasnt a solution, but half the time worked fine.
So after finnishing with the stepper control app, I decided to take a deeper look. And yeah, it is very revealing: Now you can know the limits of your device
(if any)
